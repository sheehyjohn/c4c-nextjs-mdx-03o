Two Goals.....

# 1. Something Similar to Palko
When I arrived at the Palko Launch, the person at the door asked me if I'd my ticket number & would like to buy the Album?

Before I had a chance to answer, the lead singer came over, and said
oh John doesn't need a ticket, he's our photographer
and John doesn't need an album, he's been listen

# 2. unBlock
So all I want to do is get Steve talking about the book, telling the story and further developing it

The two ideas that I hold in my head are
1. Steve arriving at the quad we me and him we're 27/28
2. Steve arriving at my house for jam at 40/50

### Having the craic on artful projects. 

If he uses none of my suggestions that is fine, as long as we have the craic and he craves out some regular time to write, play music and racquetball

# Also Also
Use Steve's work to get you in the mindset of when
Don't copy the characters, arcs or storylines

- but
- rather

use it was a way

They are different stories that are set in the same universe that never over lap - same universe becuase we are both experience the same reality and not other realities, whether or not they do exist
